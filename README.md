## About Me

I'm a Platform Engineer based in Wellington, New Zealand, passionate about automation, cloud-native technologies, and modern development practices. My journey in IT has evolved from a Windows background, starting with physical servers, then virtualization (Windows and Linux), and now fully embracing cloud-native technologies.

I believe in sharing knowledge and building reusable solutions that help others in their journey. I'm actively working on creating modular infrastructure components, reusable workflows, and documentation to make cloud infrastructure more accessible.
